# Changelog

All notable changes to Argon are documented here. Format loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) with semver versioning.
`VERSION` is the source of truth; `pyproject.toml` and `web/package.json`
version in lockstep (enforced by `scripts/release/version_sync_check.py`).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-17


### Added

- Health sidebar now shows deployed backend version in the collapsed header,
  sourced from the running process via the existing `/api/health` poll.
## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- Baseline release. Per-ticker options analytics: Next.js web (`web/`, :3001),
  FastAPI read API (`src/uw_scan/api/`, :8400), and the APScheduler worker, over
  a single Postgres (`uw_scan` schema). Scanner, regime (CRI/GEX/VCG), skew,
  Gold Compass, cockpit, and Trade Insights AI (Codex/Claude/DeepSeek) ship in
  this baseline. First release cut through the tag-driven `release.yml` pipeline.
