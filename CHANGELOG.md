# Changelog

All notable changes to Argon are documented here. Format loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) with semver versioning.
`VERSION` is the source of truth; `pyproject.toml` and `web/package.json`
version in lockstep (enforced by `scripts/release/version_sync_check.py`).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-22


### Fixed

- Release pipeline no longer wedges the mac-mini auto-deploy on `uv.lock` drift.
  `cut.sh prepare` now re-locks `uv.lock` so its editable self-version tracks the
  version bump and commits it with the release, and `version_sync_check` (run via
  system `python3` before `uv sync` in CI, so a stale committed lock can't be
  auto-repaired and hidden) fails the build if the lock self-version ever drifts
  from `VERSION` again. Previously the committed lock lagged the bump; the first
  `uv run` on any host rewrote that one line, dirtied the tree, and the deploy
  poller refused every deploy — silently pinning prod to the last-deployed
  release (the mini sat on v0.1.2 for 4 days while v0.2.0–v0.2.2 published).
## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-22


### Added

- VRP macro signal deploy slice: nightly persistence + read API for the promoted bull-put-spread signal shipped in 0.2.1. New `vrp_macro_signal_daily` table (migration 083), `vrp_macro_signal_refresh` job (03:45 ET, Mon–Fri, primary worker — runs SPX/QQQ/IWM weekly readout + `backtest_laddered` headline and persists one row per name per snapshot date, with per-name failure isolation), and `GET /api/regime/vrp-macro-signal` returning the latest signal per name. Closes the persist-every-research-trace gap for the VRP macro engine.
## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-22


### Added

- VRP macro signal engine (`reports/vrp_macro_signal.py`): promoted bull-put-spread winner config (Δ0.25 short, ramp+ vrp-z sizing, 30 trd-day hold) into first-class engine code with `WINNER` constant, `backtest_laddered` (SPX Sharpe 1.65 / QQQ OOS 1.00), and `current_macro_signal` weekly readout (TRADE/SKIP + modeled strikes/credit/max-loss)
- VRP macro research expansion (`reports/vrp_{candidates,backtest,directional,harvest_axes,gate,rv_validation}.py`): corrected-measurement engine, sector/horizon/directional/ΔVRP sweep axes, per-ticker iron-condor candidates, paper ledger, model-repriced weekly backtest
- Corporate actions refresh job (nightly 17:35 ET) for exact-RV split/dividend adjustment
## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-21


### Added

- VRP harvest markout (`reports/vrp_markout.py`, migration `079_vrp_harvest_verdicts`,
  `GET /api/regime/vrp-harvest`): scores whether selling rich vol (`vrp_z ≥ +1`) earns a
  reliable, positive premium per `(asset_class, deviation_class)` bucket. Reuses the skew
  engine's out-of-sample discipline — time-ordered walk-forward holdout plus a per-quarter
  catastrophic-degradation gate — over the existing `vrp_daily` panel, and excludes any
  forward window spanning a (flow-event-reconstructed) earnings date. Verdicts
  (`HARVEST_SELLABLE` / `NONE`) persist nightly at 18:50 ET (massive-0 worker) to
  `vrp_harvest_verdicts`; the RICH−CHEAP spread is recorded so a flat (no-edge) result
  stays legible.
## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-18


### Fixed

- Stock detail pages (Flow / Market Structure / GEX) no longer render empty
  during US off-hours. `Repository.latest_run_id` selected the newest scan_run
  via a hand-maintained `notes` denylist; the skew engine's `skew_swing_greeks`
  side-channel runs were not on it and — having higher run_ids and no aggregates
  — shadowed the real `full_scan`, blanking every ticker's detail page after
  ~17:30 ET each day. The selector (and the `get_scan_duration_summary` health
  metric) now key on the property the report actually needs —
  `status='ok' AND aggregates IS NOT NULL` — so no future side-channel job can
  re-break it. No data was lost; the fix is read-path only.
## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-17


### Added

- Health sidebar now shows deployed backend version in the collapsed header,
  sourced from the running process via the existing `/api/health` poll.
## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- Baseline release. Per-ticker options analytics: Next.js web (`web/`, :3001),
  FastAPI read API (`src/uw_scan/api/`, :8400), and the APScheduler worker, over
  a single Postgres (`uw_scan` schema). Scanner, regime (CRI/GEX/VCG), skew,
  Gold Compass, cockpit, and Trade Insights AI (Codex/Claude/DeepSeek) ship in
  this baseline. First release cut through the tag-driven `release.yml` pipeline.
